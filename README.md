# VPLOTS
This repository contains 
1. Code to generate V-plots (in code/ ) from
    1. A list of peaks (example in lib/)
    2. Single or a list of bed files (example: Reb1 ChEC-seq data from Zentner et al. (PMID: 26490019), in Dat/). The bed files should represent paired-end reads and only three columns are required: chroomosome, start of the fragment, end of the fragment.
2. Script to generate heatmap of V-plot using gnuplot (in scripts/)

The workflow is demonstrated in the directory "Test". Look at Test/commands.sh

To generate differential V-plots between two conditions (for example), you can just use shell commands (the last line of Test/commands.sh gives an example)
